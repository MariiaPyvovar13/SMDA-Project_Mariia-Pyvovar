Besides Germany doesnt even get to decide when one would be launched, the US does. \n",

We have probably the largest artillery base in EU not counting Ukraine and Russia, but with drone spotting the need to shoot and scoot is bigger than ever. So we need more of them to be Mobile artillery systems that are quick to set up, shoot, and change position. Good point would also be Drone warfare. I know the Baltics, Poland and probably Czechia feel this danger as potently as us\n",

      "And I know as EUropeans and EU members we don't need to do this very often. But write to your member of parliament, or straight to Defence minister. We need more production and production facilities for a lot more than shells and we need them soon. Please western Europeans understand our concern so that new investments can be allocated fast to certain parts of the continent and we may work together on parts creation. And I know it wont end up \"Fairly\" some countries with established Defence firms wil get more investment. But we can make this right by those companies investing in plants in countries where there isnt much defence industry. Or even make it even with some Cold hard cash to countries where little production makes sense like the baltics.\n",
